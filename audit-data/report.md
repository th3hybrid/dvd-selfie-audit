# High Issues

## H-1: Arbitrary `from` passed to `transferFrom` (or `safeTransferFrom`)

Passing an arbitrary `from` address to `transferFrom` (or `safeTransferFrom`) can lead to loss of funds, because anyone can transfer tokens from the `from` address if an approval is made.

	```solidity
	        if (!token.transferFrom(address(_receiver), address(this), _amount)) {
	```

</details>



## H-2: Contract locks Ether without a withdraw function.

It appears that the contract includes a payable function to accept Ether but lacks a corresponding function to withdraw it, which leads to the Ether being locked in the contract. To resolve this issue, please implement a public or external function that allows for the withdrawal of Ether from the contract.

	```solidity
	contract SimpleGovernance is ISimpleGovernance {
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

	```solidity
	        token.transfer(address(_receiver), _amount);
	```

- Found in src/SelfiePool.sol [Line: 69](src/SelfiePool.sol#L69)

	```solidity
	        if (!token.transferFrom(address(_receiver), address(this), _amount)) {
	```

	```solidity
	        token.transfer(receiver, amount);
	```

</details>



## L-2: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

- Found in src/SimpleGovernance.sol [Line: 19](src/SimpleGovernance.sol#L19)

	```solidity
	        _votingToken = votingToken;
	```

</details>



## L-3: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/DamnValuableVotes.sol [Line: 19](src/DamnValuableVotes.sol#L19)

	```solidity
	    function nonces(address owner) public view virtual override(ERC20Permit, Nonces) returns (uint256) {
	```

</details>



## L-4: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.
